# Hello World


Welcome to my first post serving as an introductory! Created this blog entitled "Modern-Day Software Engineering" to reflect my opinions regarding
the quickly changing technical landscape that developers like me face. This site will not only help me document my struggles
& observations through my journeys but hopefully will help others as well. 

No first entry by a programmer can be complete without the traditional/canonical Hello World program:
 
```kotlin
fun main() {
    println("Welcome to Modern-Day Software Engineering!")
}
```

This site will always be considered a "work in progress" so it should be interesting to see how it evolves over time!
